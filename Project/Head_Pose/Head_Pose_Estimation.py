Head Pose Estimation
Original url:
https://www.learnopencv.com/head-pose-estimation-using-opencv-and-dlib/

A 3D rigid object has only two kinds of motions with respect to a camera.

Translation : Moving the camera from its current 3D location (X, Y, Z) to a new 3D location (X', Y', Z') is called translation. As you can see translation has 3 degrees of freedom â€” you can move in the X, Y or Z direction. Translation is represented by a vector \mathbf{t} which is equal to ( X' - X, Y' - Y, Z' - Z ).
Rotation : You can also rotate the camera about the X, Y and Z axes. A rotation, therefore, also has three degrees of freedom. There are many ways of representing rotation. You can represent it using Euler angles ( roll, pitch and yaw ), a 3\times3 rotation matrix, or a direction of rotation (i.e. axis ) and angle.

In OpenCV the function 
    - solvePnP 
    - solvePnPRansac 
can be used to estimate pose.
